## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of several classical machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch without using machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn, to give you a foundational understanding of the mechanics and the mathematics behind each algorithm.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Gradient Descent**
4. **Linear Regression**
5. **K-Mean Clustering**

Each algorithm is located in its respective directory and includes:
- A Python file with the implementation (`.py`)
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) demonstrating the usage and performance of the algorithm on sample datasets
- A README file explaining the theory behind the algorithm and detailing the implementation steps

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Additionally, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

## Usage 

You can run the implementations directly as Python scripts or use the Jupyter Notebooks provided to see the algorithms in action on sample datasets.
```bash
python knn.py
jupyter notebook KNN/knn_demo.ipynb
```
