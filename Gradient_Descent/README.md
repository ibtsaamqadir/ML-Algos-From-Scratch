## Introduction

Gradient Descent is a crucial optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning to optimize model parameters. It iteratively adjusts model parameters by moving in the direction of the steepest decrease in the cost function, ultimately finding the minimum value of the cost function.

## Algorithm Overview

The Gradient Descent algorithm works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Start with initial guesses for the model parameters (e.g., weights).
2. **Calculate Gradients**: Compute the gradients, which are the partial derivatives of the cost function concerning each parameter.
3. **Update Parameters**: Adjust the parameters by moving in the direction opposite to the gradients, scaled by a learning rate.
4. **Iteration**: Repeat the process until convergence, i.e., when the change in the cost function becomes negligible.

### Key Concepts

- **Cost Function**: A function that measures the error or loss of the model's predictions. The goal is to minimize this function.
- **Gradients**: Partial derivatives of the cost function concerning each parameter, indicating the direction and rate of the steepest ascent.
- **Learning Rate**: A hyperparameter that controls the step size of each parameter update.
